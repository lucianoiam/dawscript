- get_parameter_range() broken on Live, test with plugin AUGraphicEQ:
  live   : [    0,  1.0]
  reaper : [-20.0, 20.0]

- zeroconf is not available on Live because its built-in Python interpreter
  apparently has no support for the ctypes module, which is required by ifaddr.
  Can be fixed by calling dnd-sd on macOS or avahi-publish on Linux. These tools
  are also available for Windows.
