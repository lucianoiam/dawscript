- get_parameter_range() broken on Live, test with plugin AUGraphicEQ:
  live   : [    0,  1.0]
  reaper : [-20.0, 20.0]

- The zeroconf module is not available on Live because its built-in Python
  interpreter apparently lacks support for ctypes, which is required by ifaddr.
  The fallback is to run dns-sd, which is available on major operating systems
  but is only built-in on macOS.
